Physical address represents actual location of data inside RAM.
Virtual address, in its turn, is used for easier management of 
memory (e.g. by using MMU). It is some kind of abstraction, so
each process can think that it has the whole address space to use 
for yourself (while in reality it is dynamically allocated/deallocated
by some memory manager)
